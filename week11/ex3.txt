1st program output is 
"Hello
Hello

"
2nd program output is
"Hello

"
This happens because before printing "Hello" goes to buffer and after forking the process new process also prints "Hello".
But in case we have "\n" in the buffer - it clears the buffer, therefore, 2nd program does not print "Hello" after forking
