1. To increase hit ratio, it is needed to reference pages consequently
  in the reversed order they were referenced before. For example sequence
  1 2 3 4 5 5 4 3 2 1 with frame = 4 will experience only 6 misses: 
  from 1 to 4 we have misses and put 1-4 to frame, 
  when referencing to 5 we delete 1 as the least recent one and put 5 on it's place. 
  For 5,4,3,2 we have hits and for last 1 one more miss appears.

2. at the same time sequence 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 with frame = 4 will experience
  10 misses (0 hits).So, the worst idea is to put references in the same order
  or approximately same order. Because all the pages will be replaced in thame before the next reference.
